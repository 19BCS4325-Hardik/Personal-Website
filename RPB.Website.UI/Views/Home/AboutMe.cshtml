                I'm Rick Bowman, a software developer from Appleton Wisconsin. I started programming in 2014 by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and a bit of Python.
                After a brief break from programming, I decided to get an Associate Degree in Software Development from Fox Valley Technical College, which I finished in spring 2018.
                My skillset is focused mostly in the .Net framework using technologies such as: C#, SQL, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, WinForms, WPF, .Net Core, ASP.Net, ASP.Net MVC, Razor, LINQ,
                Entity Framework, Web API, and some Azure services. I have also dabbled in C++, PHP, Xamarin, Swift, and Unity. Outside of programming my interests include woodworking,
                electronic music, video games, and outer space.
